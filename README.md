# GetUserName

This C# console application shows all log files on all drives connected to a Desktop PC system. The script also reports the security group and account username of any process that interferes with the .log files system wide. The application manifest configuration has been changed to allow the script to operate on an elevated privaledge to ensure the user may see every group and account name without breaking the script's operation.
